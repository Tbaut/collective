about: >
  I started to work with Polkadot in 2022 after coming from the Ethereum world.
  Polkadot immediately grabbed my attention for its impressive tech stack - not
  so much the UI/UX ðŸ˜….  
motivation: I saw the Decentralization happening and thought that now would be a
  good time to add some Dev Tooling to the list of decentralized funded
  projects.
